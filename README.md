## Market Basket Analysis with Association Rule Mining

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to introduce and apply rule mining techniques, with a particular focus on market basket analysis. Students will gain hands-on experience in discovering associations between products using the Apriori algorithm and interpreting the results to understand customer purchasing behavior.

### Dataset
Dataset Used: Online Retail dataset, which contains transactional data for market basket analysis.

### Data Preprocessing
#### Data Preparation:
- Handle missing values to ensure data completeness.
- Remove duplicates to avoid skewed results.
- Convert data into a format suitable for association rule mining, such as transaction-based format.

### Association Rule Mining
### Apriori Algorithm Implementation:
- Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas and Mlxtend to implement the Apriori algorithm.
- Apply association rule mining techniques to the pre-processed dataset to uncover relationships between products purchased together.

#### Rule Extraction:
- Set appropriate thresholds for support, confidence, and lift to extract meaningful association rules.

### Analysis and Interpretation
#### Rule Analysis:
- Analyze the generated association rules to identify interesting patterns and relationships between products.
#### Insights:
-Interpret the results to provide insights into customer purchasing behavior based on the discovered rules.
